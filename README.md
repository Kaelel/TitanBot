# TitanBot2

To get an instance up and running, youll need a few things:

- [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)
- The myget feed for discord.net (https://www.myget.org/F/discord-net/api/v3/index.json) set up in visual studio nuget package manager
- A valid bot token, available [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me)

Once done, you should be able to compile and run your own instance
